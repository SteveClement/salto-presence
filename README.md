# Salto presence project

This will show either a text based list or a web frontend to make a guesstimate who has badged into a Salto operated office.


# Short-comings

Currently only ONE reader is considered if a user is present. Ideally the one of the main entrance or the one with the most traffic.

# Face detection

The face detection is curently used for an OG easter egg.

# Dependencies

[HAAR file for face detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)

OpenCV needs: `apt install libgl-dev`
